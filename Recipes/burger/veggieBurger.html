  <h2 class="one">Description</h2>
  <p>These vegetarian mushroom burgers are as close as I've ever gotten to delicious meatless burgers. Mushrooms really give
  them a meaty flavor. I like to serve them on fresh hamburger rolls with spicy mayonnaise and a little lettuce.</p>
  <h3 class="ingre">Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>3 (8 ounce) packages slices fresh mushroom</li>
    <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tablespoonblack pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 tablespoondried oregano</li>
    <li>3/4 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
    <li>2/3 cup rolled oats</li>
    <li>1/2 cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="how">Step-By-Step</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano;
    cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from
    the heat.</li>
    <li>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet.</li>
    <li>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and season with salt and
    pepper as needed. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread crumbs have absorbed any excess
    liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into patties.
</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet until golden brown
    and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
  </ol>
